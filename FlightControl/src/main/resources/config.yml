# An EXTREMELY IMPORTANT idea to understand for part of this configuration is that flight only enables when it
# has a reason to (it does not stay enabled in a neutral/un-enabled location).

# Should FlightControl automatically update to the latest version?
# (It will update the config automatically and add new features!)
auto_update: true

settings:
  # Enables flight automatically (no command necessary)
  auto_enable: true
  # Controls flight speed (default speed is 1)
  # The speed values match Essential's /flyspeed command (the number range is 0-10)
  flight_speed: 1.0
  # Requires CombatTagPlus, CombatLogX, or AntiCombatLogging
  # NOTE: in the combat plugin config, deactivate its option to disable flight while in combat to prevents issues
  disable_flight_in_combat: false
  # Prevents fall damage when flight is disabled mid-air by FlightControl
  prevent_fall_damage: false
  # Requires EssentialsX or PremiumVanish
  # Bypasses the disabling of flight while in vanish (or spectating)
  vanish_bypass: true
  # Requires Factions (by MassiveCraft), FactionsUUID, or SavageFactions
  # Disables flight while a faction enemy is within a certain block range (set to -1 to disable)
  # NOTE: this feature may cause performance issues on larger servers
  disable_enemy_range: -1

worlds:
  # Change "enable" to "disable" if you want it to disable in certain worlds instead
  # (and enable in the ones not listed)
  enable:
  - exampleworld

# Requires WorldGuard (and WorldEdit)
# If you have multiple regions overlapping each other, please use /rg setpriority REGIONNAME NUMBER
# FlightControl checks the HIGHEST priority region (otherwise it checks the first in REVERSE alphabetical order)
regions:
  # Change "enable" to "disable" if you want flight to disable in certain regions instead
  # (and enable in the ones not listed)
  enable:
    exampleworld:
    - exampleregion

    - exampleregion2

# Requires Factions (by MassiveCraft), FactionsUUID, or SavageFactions
# There are eight types of faction territories (OWN, ALLY, TRUCE, NEUTRAL, ENEMY, WARZONE, SAFEZONE, WILDERNESS)
# OWN enables flight in the player's own faction territory
factions:
  # "example" is a category (the permission to use it is flightcontrol.factions.example)
  # Keep in mind you can set category names to whatever you want (only alphanumeric characters, no spaces)
  example:
    # Change "enable" to "disable" if you want flight to disable in certain faction territories instead
    # (and enable in the ones not listed)
    enable:
    - OWN
    - ALLY
  # "example2" is another category (the permission to use it is flightcontrol.factions.example2)
  example2:
    enable:
    - SAFEZONE
    - WARZONE

# Requires Towny
towny:
  # Enables flight in player's own town
  enable_own_town: false
  # Disables all Towny-related flight during war
  # (this also affects the permission!)
  disable_during_war: false

# Compatible: EssentialsX, PremiumVanish (disables while vanished)
