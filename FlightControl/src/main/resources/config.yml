# A VERY IMPORTANT idea to understand for part of this configuration is that flight disables when it
# has a reason to disable OR it does not have a reason to enable (a whitelist basically). I will
# be implementing an option to turn it into a blacklist SOON (it will enable unless it has a reason to disable).

settings:
  # Enables /fly instead of automatic flight
  # When "command" is enabled, "can_enable" and "cannot_enable" messages/sounds are used
  command: false

  # Requires: CombatTagPlus, CombatLogX, or AntiCombatLogging
  # NOTE: in the combat plugin config, disable its option to stop flight while in combat (prevents issues)
  disable_flight_in_combat: false

  # Prevents fall damage when flight is disabled mid-air by FlightControl
  prevent_fall_damage: false

  # Bypasses the disabling of flight while in vanish (or spectating)
  # Requires: EssentialsX or PremiumVanish
  vanish_bypass: true

  # Spawns cloud particles under players that are flying (in motion)
  # Requires: version/fork of SPIGOT (unless you are using 1.13)
  # Compatible: EssentialsX, PremiumVanish (disables while vanished)
  flight_trail: false

# Enables flight in certain worlds
# To set it to a blacklist (flight will only disable in the listed worlds),
# change "enable" to "disable" before the world list
worlds:
  # To change this from a whitelist to a blacklist (flight will enable unless disabled),
  # change "enable" to "disable"
  enable:
    - exampleworld

# Enables flight in certain WorldGuard regions
# Requires: WorldGuard (and WorldEdit)
# If you have multiple regions overlapping each other, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE use /rg setpriority REGIONNAME NUMBER
# FlightControl checks the player's HIGHEST priority region (otherwise it checks the first in REVERSE alphabetical order)
regions:
  # To change this from a whitelist to a blacklist (flight will enable unless disabled),
  # change "enable" to "disable"
  enable:
    exampleworld:
    - exampleregion
    exapleworld2:
    - exampleregion2

# Enables flight in certain faction regions
# Requires: Factions (by MassiveCraft), FactionsUUID, or SavageFactions
# There are eight types of faction territories (OWN, ALLY, TRUCE, NEUTRAL, ENEMY, WARZONE, SAFEZONE, WILDERNESS)
# OWN enables flight in the player's own faction territory
factions:
  # "example" is a category (the permission to use it is flightcontrol.factions.example)
  # Keep in mind you can set category names to whatever you want (only alphanumeric characters, no spaces)
  example:
    # To change this from a whitelist to a blacklist (flight will enable unless disabled),
    # change "enable" to "disable"
    enable:
    - OWN
    - ALLY

  # "example2" is a category (the permission to use it is flightcontrol.factions.example2)
  example2:
    enable:
    - SAFEZONE
    - WARZONE

sounds:
  # Please use the sound names from the "Sound Event" section of the table
  # on https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Sounds.json#Java_Edition_values
  # USE THE CORRECT TABLE (Java Edition values before 1.9) if you are using 1.8!
  enable:
    sound: "NONE"
    pitch: 1
    volume: 1
  disable:
    sound: "NONE"
    pitch: 1
    volume: 1
  # "can_enable" and "cannot_enable" are only used when "command" is true
  # (do you have the chance to notify the player that they can/cannot if it's already enabled?)
  can_enable:
    sound: "NONE"
    pitch: 1
    volume: 1
  cannot_enable:
    sound: "NONE"
    pitch: 1
    volume: 1

# If you do not wish for a message to be sent, set it to ""
# You can use "&" for color codes just like any other plugin!
messages:
  # Use the actionbar (area above hotbar) instead of chat for certain notifications
  actionbar: false
  flight:
    enable: "&aYour flight has been enabled."
    disable: "&cYour flight has been disabled."
    # "can_enable" and "cannot_enable" are only used when "command" is true
    # (do you have the chance to notify the player that they can/cannot if it's already enabled?)
    can_enable: "&bYou can use /fly now."
    cannot_enable: "&cYou cannot fly right now."
