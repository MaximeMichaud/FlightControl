# Players can only fly in regions that they are granted flight, so there is
# no need to disable flight unless you want to override an area that you have enabled.

# In other words,
# - disabling HAS GREATER PRIORITY than enabling
# - if neither enabling nor disabling is set for an area, FLIGHT WILL STILL DISABLE!!
